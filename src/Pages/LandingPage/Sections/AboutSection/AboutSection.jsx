              We promote an innovation driven entrepreneurship culture among the
              students. We identify all possible ways by which our students can
              achieve a successful career. We also help to mould them as job
              providers, not as job seekers.

              Students are encouraged to think out of the syllabus to identify
              problems, which canâ€™t be solved, and to develop a product as
              outcome of solution. They are given end to end support through
              which they can file a patent and market the product.

              innovators, in skilling and sharpening their entrepreneurial skill
              sets. We develop and promote commercially viable innovative
